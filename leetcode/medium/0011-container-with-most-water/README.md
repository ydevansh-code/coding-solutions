# Container With Most Water

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return  *the maximum amount of water a container can store*.

 **Notice**  that you may not slant the container.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- n == height.length
- 2 <= n <= 105
- 0 <= height[i] <= 104

```c
int maxArea(int* height, int heightSize) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = heightSize - 1;
    int max = 0;

    while (left < right) {
        int h;

        if (height[left] < height[right])
            h = height[left];
        else
            h = height[right];

        int width = right - left;
        int area = h * width;

        if (area > max)
            max = area;

        // Move the smaller height
        if (height[left] < height[right])
            left++;
        else
            right--;
    }

    return max;
}
```
